          <p class="card-text">I love spending time with my family. I live with 
            my wife — we don't have any children yet, but we're still a family. 
            We really enjoy going on day trips to explore nearby places, having 
            small private BBQs at home just for the two of us, and listening to 
            music together.

          <h2 class="card-title">Travel</h2>
          <p class="card-text">I really love traveling to different cities and 
            places. Exploring new places and understanding the local culture is 
            something I truly enjoy, whether I'm alone or with others. One of 
            the most iconic places I've been to is Chichén Itzá.

          <h2 class="card-title">Motorbikes</h2>
          <p class="card-text">I learned how to ride motorbikes when I was 11 
            years old. At the time, I wasn't even able to touch the ground while 
            sitting on the motorbike. Nowadays, I enjoy exploring places where  
            cars can't reach and feeling the air on my face while riding.

          <h2 class="card-title">Hiking</h2>
          <p class="card-text">I studied geology. While I was at university, I 
            did a lot of field trips and used to do a lot of hiking and camping. 
            That's where I got my love for hiking and exploring new places. What 
            I enjoy the most about hiking is discovering places where only a few 
            people have set foot.
