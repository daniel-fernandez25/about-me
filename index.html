          <p class="card-text">I love spending time with my family. 
          I live with my wife, we don't have any children yet, but
          we're still a family. We really enjoy to go on one day 
          trips to explore places nearby, we like having small private  
          BBQs at home only for both of us, and listen to music together.

          <p class="card-text">I really love traveling to different
          cities and places, exploring new places and understanding
          the local culture is one of the things I can really enjoy
          whether I'm alore or with others. One of the most iconic 
          places I've been is Chitchén Itzá.

          <p class="card-text">I learned how to ride motorbikes when I
          was 11 years old. At the time I learned I was not even able 
          to stand in the floor while sitting on the motorbike. Nowdays
          I like exploring places where no cars can get to and feeling the 
          air in my face when riding a motorbike.

          <h2 class="card-title">Hiking</h2>
          <p class="card-text">I studied geology, while I was at university
          I did a lot of fieldtrips and used to do a lot of hiking and 
          camping. From there I got my love for hiking and exploring new
          places. When hiking what I enjoy the most is being able to
          discover new places where only a few people has put their feet on.
